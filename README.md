# Global-Terrorism-Analysis
## Project Overview
In this project we are trying to:
* Explore the dataset to understand its structure and features.
* Handle missing values and perform data cleaning where necessary.
* Use Dask to handle large data efficiently and compare the performance with Pandas for certain operations.
* Perform basic statistical analysis to summarize the data.
* Drive insights from the data.
* Performance Comparison between Dask and Pandas
## About Dataset
The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017. The GTD includes systematic data on domestic as well as international terrorist incidents that have occurred during this time period and now includes more than 180,000 attacks. The database is maintained by researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), headquartered at the University of Maryland.
You can find the dataset on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd
